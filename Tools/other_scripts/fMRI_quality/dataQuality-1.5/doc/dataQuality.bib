	Year = {1999 Jun},
	Abstract = {A data acquisition and analysis protocol for quality control (QC) of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies is presented. Two sets of data are acquired, single-timepoint data for measurement of signal-to-ghost and signal-to-noise ratios, and multiple-timepoint data for measurement of short-term drift. Since manual data analysis can be time consuming and an impediment to regular QC, an automated data processing scheme is presented. The use of automated Shewhart charting is proposed to identify significant changes in each parameter over the long term. The protocol has successfully identified system faults and deteriorations undetected by conventional QC.}}

	Abstract = {Functional MR imaging (fMRI) of activation in the brain is one of the more demanding applications required of an NMR imaging instrument. Since the signal changes in activation imaging are quite small, any instrumental variations can easily compromise the fMRI contrast. The authors describe a simple method for measuring these scanner instabilities, which is implementable on all scanners, to determine whether instability is degrading the fMRI contrast-to-noise. In this method, a long time series of images is acquired with identical imaging parameters to the chosen fMRI scans, the fluctuations are measured as a function of region-of-interest (ROI) size, and compared with the single image SNR. By plotting these fluctuations versus ROI size, and comparing them with the theoretically approachable value, the impact of these fluctuations can be assessed. We also present a simplified version of the test, which can be implemented with minimal calculations.},

	Abstract = {Temporal stability during an fMRI acquisition is very important because the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effects of interest are only a few percent in magnitude. Also, studies involving the collection of groups of subjects over time require stable scanner performance over days, weeks, months, and even years. We describe a protocol designed by one of the authors that has been tested for several years within the context of a large, multicenter collaborative fMRI research project (FIRST-BIRN). A full description of the phantom, the quality assurance (QA) protocol, and the several calculations used to measure performance is provided. The results obtained with this protocol at multiple sites over time are presented. These data can be used as benchmarks for other centers involved in fMRI research. Some issues with the various protocol measures are highlighted and discussed, and possible protocol improvements are also suggested. Overall, we expect that other fMRI centers will find this approach to QA useful and this report may facilitate developing a similar QA protocol locally. Based on the findings reported herein, the authors are convinced that monitoring QA in this way will improve the quality of fMRI data.},
